# VideoDubber
[VideoDubber: Machine Translation with Speech-Aware Length Control for Video Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16934), by Yihan Wu, Junliang Guo, Xu Tan, Chen Zhang, Bohan Li, Ruihua Song, Lei He, Sheng Zhao, Arul Menezes, Jiang Bian, is a novel machine translation framework with speech length control for video dubbing. Our implement is based on the opensource code of [Fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq). The video samples can be found in the [demo page](https://speechresearch.github.io/videodubbing/).

## Install

Prepare envirommemt:
```
# Install Moses
git clone https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder.git

# Install Subword Neural Machine Translation which contains preprocessing scripts to segment text into subword units.
git clone https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt.git

# Install jieba for Chinese text segmentation
pip install jieba

# Install fairseq
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./

```

## Quick Start

prepare your own data and train your model following this command: 

```
